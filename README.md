# **Analyzing and Predicting AAPL and TSLA Stock Prices**

The project focuses on two globally influential companies, Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA), and 
leverages seven years of historical stock price data collected from finance.yahoo.com.
The data was preprocessed and analyzed using tools like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and 
Seaborn. Linear regression models were built and trained using Scikit-Learn, achieving an 
accuracy of 99.25% and 98.18% in predicting AAPL and TSLA stock prices respectively. The 
project also delves into the impact of significant events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, 
inclusion in S&P500, etc. on stock prices.


`PROBLEM STATEMENT` :
The financial market is a sophisticated system in which a wide range of variables interact in 
complex ways to affect stock values. Accurately predicting these values is difficult because of 
their volatility and the wide range of affecting factors. By projecting the stock values of two 
highly significant firms in the world, Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA), this research 
seeks to answer this difficulty.
"Can we correctly analyze the stock prices and carry out diagnostic analysis alongside 
developing a model that accurately predicts the future stock prices of AAPL and TSLA based 
on historical data?" is the specific problem this project aims to solve. We will use a variety of 
AI and Data Science tools like Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
Scikit-Learn, etc. and approaches like Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression to evaluate 
past stock price data and create a predictive model in order to respond to this issue. We will 
perform majority of this project in Jupyter notebooks.
The project's success will be determined by how well our model predicts the future. A good 
conclusion would offer important insights into the elements influencing these prices in addition 
to proving that stock prices can be predicted using AI and data science techniques.
